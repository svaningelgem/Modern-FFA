We are pleased to introduce the FFA (Free-For-All) plugin compatible with Minecraft version 1.21. This sophisticated plugin supports an array of commands, enhancing the gameplay experience for both players and staff members. Below is a comprehensive overview of the commands:

/ffa setspawn: Empowers staff members with the ffa.setspawn permission to designate the spawn location for players, either upon death or server entry.
/ffa setarena <name>: Enables staff with the ffa.setarena permission to create and name specific arenas for player teleportation.
/ffa setviparena: Allows staff with the ffa.setviparena permission to establish exclusive arenas accessible only to players with the requisite ranks or permissions.
/ffa viparena: Permits players to join the VIP arena, contingent upon having the ffa.viparena permission.
/ffa arena <name>: Facilitates player teleportation to pre-set arenas, displaying the arena's name prominently upon arrival. This command is universally accessible without any permission requirements.
/ffa createkit <name>: Authorizes staff with the ffa.createkit permission to create kits that save the playerâ€™s current inventory items and effects.
/ffa kit <name>: Allows players to equip pre-created kits.
/ffa setpositionresetmap <name>: After executing this command in a specific arena, the user can delineate the arena boundaries using a wooden axe and finalize the setup with the ffa.setpointresetmap command.
/ffa enableresetarena <name> <time>: This command resets a designated arena to its default state after a specified duration, replenishing or removing blocks, items, and entities as necessary. This process is optimized to avoid crashes or excessive resource consumption.
In addition to these commands, the plugin features an automated health and hunger bar replenishment system upon a successful kill. When a player eliminates an opponent, the following messages appear:

Messages supported:
- Killer's POV: A green action-bar message: "You have killed <victim> with <number of hearts> left. You gained 20 hearts." (where <victim> and <number of hearts> are highlighted in red).
- Victim's POV: A red action-bar message: "You have been killed by <killer>. They have <number of hearts> left." (with <killer> highlighted in orange).
- Moreover, the plugin mitigates the issue of free-hitting by instituting a duel request system. When a player wishes to initiate combat, they must first punch their desired opponent, triggering a green chat message in the recipient's POV: "<hitter> wants to fight against you" (with <hitter> highlighted in orange). This message appears only once every 10 seconds to prevent spam. If the recipient reciprocates the hit, the duel commences.

We trust that these features will significantly enhance your gaming experience. Should you require further assistance or have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Happy gaming!
